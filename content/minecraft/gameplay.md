# Gameplay

You begin your journey in **Sanctuary**.
A world stripped of resources. No ores, no trees, no animals, no grass.
Even enemies refuse to spawn.
Crops and saplings grow painfully slow, making farming an unreliable option.
This is not the place to survive — it's the place to *build*.

To gather resources, you must enter **The Abyss**: a brutal, ever-shifting world regenerated weekly with fresh loot and danger.
Here you mine, fight, loot, and die, then return to **Sanctuary** to store your riches and shape your permanent home.
**Sanctuary** is eternal. **The Abyss** will devour everything left behind.

**Raid The Abyss → Escape with loot → Build and progress in Sanctuary.**

## Feed the Flame

Food is scarce in **Sanctuary**.
Aside from the daily **Alms** from the **Reliquary** (and the occasional stolen food), you must rely on your **Praying Candle** to restore hunger and health.
Each prayer extinguishes a flame, and relighting it costs [**Flint and Steel**](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Flint_and_Steel) durability.

Your first milestone should therefore be to craft a [**Flint and Steel**](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Flint_and_Steel).

To reduce wear and fuel more prayers, craft more [**Candles**](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Candle) and stack them together.
Lighting one stacked candle lights them all, granting more uses per flint!

Candles also store experience, protecting it from death in **The Abyss**.
More candles let you store more experience.

## Voice of the Heart

**Sanctuary's Heart** holds four unstable dimensional rifts, each with unique events, schedules, and NPCs. Some appear regularly; others are rare and unpredictable...

Most buildings, NPCs, and events revolve around **Emeralds**, either earning them or spending them.
Key visitors like the **Society Voices** offer **Edicts**. Complete them to earn **Favor**, which leads to rewards from the **Reliquary**, containing **Emeralds** and other useful items.

Since **The Abyss** has no villagers, **Sanctuary's** systems are your only reliable trade hub.

## Bind the Bones

The villagers in Sanctuary are a fine start, but eventually, you'll want to sell your items to other players, or request rare items! To do that, you'll need a **Bone Vessel**.
A merchant that speaks on your behalf, even when you're off-line or lost in **The Abyss**.

To gain one, speak to the **Abyss Trader** and obtain a **Letter to the Soil**.
With it in your inventory, the **Gravecarver** will take notice the next time he appears.
He does not care for small talk, but he will reanimate a trader's remains and bind them to you in service.

Your **Vessel** must be placed beside a newly placed container. That container becomes the shop's inventory, holding both what's for sale and what other players sell back.

If you want the **Vessel** to buy something you don't yet have, just rename a piece of [**Paper**](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Paper) in an [**Anvil**](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Anvil) with the name of the item you're requesting.

As long as you keep it stocked and maintained, your **Vessel** will do the work while you're gone.

## Grow Your Claim

With your home built and wealth secured, it's time to expand your influence in **Sanctuary**!

While you can manage your land with a [**Golden Shovel**](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Golden_Shovel), increasing the size of your claim requires more claim blocks. These are not handed out freely.

Trade with the **Abyss Trader** to obtain a **Whisper Leaf**.
With it in your possession, the elusive **Claimwright** will acknowledge you when he next appears.

He speaks to few, but if he does, he will grant you additional blocks to expand your land.

You can use your new blocks to stretch your current home, or to stake out new ground elsewhere.
Perhaps for a second base, or a more visible shop?
