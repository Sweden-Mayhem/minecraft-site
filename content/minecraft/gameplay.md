# Gameplay

You begin your journey in **Sanctuary**.
A world stripped of resources. No ores, no trees, no animals, no grass.
Crops and saplings grow painfully slow, making farming an unreliable option.
This is not the place to survive — it's the place to *build*.

To gather resources, you must enter **The Abyss**: a brutal, ever-shifting world regenerated weekly with fresh loot and danger.
Here you mine, fight, loot, and die, then return to **Sanctuary** to store your riches and shape your permanent home.
**Sanctuary** is eternal. **The Abyss** will devour everything left behind.

**Raid The Abyss → Escape with loot → Build and progress in Sanctuary.**

## Feed the Flame

Food is scarce in **Sanctuary**.
Aside from the daily **Alms** from the **Reliquary** (and the occasional stolen food item), you must rely on your **Praying Candle** to restore hunger and health.

But because each prayer extinguishes a flame, you must find a reliable way to relight your candle.
Your first milestone should therefore be to craft a [**Flint and Steel**](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Flint_and_Steel).

To reduce wear and fuel more prayers, gather more [**Candles**](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Candle) and stack them together.
Lighting one stacked candle lights them all, granting more uses per flint!

Praying also lets you store your experience, protecting it from death in **The Abyss**.
The more candles you stack, the more experience you can store.

## Voice of the Heart

Your second focus should now be to explore **Sanctuary's Heart**, the strange center where four unstable dimensional rifts connect **Sanctuary** to other worlds.
Each has its own events, NPCs, and opportunities. Some appear regularly; others are rare and unpredictable...

Most structures and events revolve around **Emeralds**, either earning them or spending them.
Key visitors like the **Society Voices** offer **Edicts**. Complete them to earn **Favor**, which leads to rewards from the **Reliquary**, including **Emeralds** and other useful items.
Other visitors might offer to trade and sell you items directly.

Since **The Abyss** has no villagers, **Sanctuary** is your only reliable trade hub.

## Bind the Bones

The villagers in **Sanctuary** are a fine start, but eventually, you'll want to sell your items to other players, or request rare items! To do that, you'll need a **Bone Vessel**.
A merchant that speaks on your behalf, even when you're off-line or lost in **The Abyss**.

Start by speaking with the **Abyss Trader** to obtain a **Letter to the Soil**.
With it in your inventory, the **Gravecarver** will take notice when he next appears.
He does not care for small talk, but he will reanimate a trader's remains and bind them to you in service.

Your **Vessel** must be placed beside a newly placed container. That container becomes the shop's inventory — holding both what's for sale and what other players sell back.

If you want the **Vessel** to buy something you don't yet have, just rename a piece of [**Paper**](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Paper) in an [**Anvil**](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Anvil) with the name of the item you're requesting.

As long as you keep it stocked and maintained, your **Vessel** will do the work while you're gone.

## Grow Your Claim

With your home built and wealth secured, it's time to expand your influence in **Sanctuary**!

While you can manage your land with a [**Golden Shovel**](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Golden_Shovel), increasing the size of your claim requires more claim blocks, and these are not handed out freely.

Trade with the **Abyss Trader** to obtain a **Whisperleaf**.
With it in your possession, the elusive **Claimwright** may finally acknowledge your presence.
If he speaks, it means you've done well for **Sanctuary**, and he will grant you additional claim blocks in return.

You can use your new blocks to stretch your current home, or to stake out new ground elsewhere.
Perhaps for a second base, or a more visible shop?
