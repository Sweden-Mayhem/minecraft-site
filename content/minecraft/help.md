# Praying

Praying offers a number of beneficial effects 
Not only does it let you store your currently held experience, it can also restore health and hunger, and grant powerful boons.
Praying is only available in **Sanctuary**.

## The Praying Menu

You can open the praying menu by right-clicking any lit [Candle](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Candle) you have access to in **Sanctuary**.

Any action you take in the menu will consume one flame from the candle.
You can stack multiple candles to increase the number of available flames, and lighting one lights the whole stack.

Candles are usually lit with a [Flint and Steel](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Flint_and_Steel).

## Experience

Praying allows you to deposit and withdraw experience as **Divine Experience**.
There is no penalty for depositing or withdrawing experience.
However, the amount of **Divine Experience** you can store depends on how many candles are stacked together.

The current **Divine Experience** limits are:

- **1 Candle**: 500
- **2 Candles**: 2500
- **3 Candles**: 7000
- **4 Candles**: 15000

## Alignment and Boons

At certain structures within **Sanctuary's Heart**, you can use the `/pray` command to align yourself with either **Good** or **Bad**.
There is a time limit of **30 minutes** between prayers, and the alignment depends on the structure you pray at.

A strong enough alignment unlocks powerful boons in the praying menu, offering strong temporary buffs.
Your alignment is reset to **Neutral** after a boon has been applied.

# Claims

A **Claim** is a player-owned area in **Sanctuary**, where items and blocks are safe from other players.
There is currently no limit to the number of claims you can own, and you can freely remove, resize, or expand any claim, as long as you have enough claim blocks.

Placing your first chest in **Sanctuary** will automatically create a small claim area.

Use `/claimslist` to view your current claims and remaining claim blocks.
To abandon a claim, stand inside it and use `/abandonclaim` or `/abandonallclaims` to remove all your claims.

## Visualizing Claims

There are two ways to visualize claim boundaries.
First, equip a [Stick](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Stick), then:

- Right-click any claimed block to visualize the claim boundaries
- While crouching, right-click any block to visualize all nearby claims

There are two types of claim boundaries:

- **Gold** indicate player-owned claims
- **Red** indicate protected areas you cannot modify or claim

The boundaries will automatically hide after a while.
To hide the boundaries early, right-click any unclaimed block with your [Stick](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Stick).

## Trust and Permissions

You can allow other players to access or build in your claim.
While standing inside your claim, use one of the following commands:

- `/trustlist` — Lists players with permissions
- `/trust <player>` — Full build/edit/container access (be careful!)
- `/containertrust <player>` — Access to chests, furnaces, etc.
- `/accesstrust <player>` — Access to doors, buttons, beds
- `/permissiontrust <player>` — Allows the player to grant others access
- `/untrust <player>` — Remove permissions from a player
- `/untrust all` — Remove all permissions from everyone

## Subdividing Claims

You can split a claim into smaller **subclaims**, each with their own permission settings.
For example, you can allow visitors to build in one area, while keeping the rest private.

While standing inside your claim, equip a [Golden Shovel](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Golden_Shovel), then:

- `/subdivideclaims` — Enables subdivision mode for your shovel
- `/basicclaims` — Returns your shovel to normal mode
- `/restrictsubclaim` — Prevents a subclaim from inheriting permissions from its parent

## Resizing Claims

You are free to resize your claims at any time.
Reducing the size will return any claim blocks used in the removed area, while expanding will require additional claim blocks.
You cannot shrink a claim to below 80 blocks, or a width less than 5 blocks.

While standing inside your claim, equip your [Golden Shovel](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Golden_Shovel), then:

1. Right-click one of the glowing gold corner markers
2. Right-click again to set the new size:
	- **Inside** the current area to shrink
	- **Outside** the current area to expand

## Creating a New Claim

To create a new claim area:

- You must have at least 80 claim blocks available
- The claim must be at least 80 blocks and at least 5 blocks wide

Then:

1. Use a [Stick](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Stick) to locate unclaimed land
2. Equip your [Golden Shovel](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Golden_Shovel)
3. Right-click an unclaimed block
4. Right-click the opposite corner diagonally to create the claim

# Sanctuary's Heart

The four central locations in **Sanctuary** rotate through different events, NPCs, and structures.
Most are active between **08:00 - 23:00** Swedish time, though some minor occurrences happen outside those hours.

Each structure includes at least one container (often hidden) that may contain loot, refreshed at random intervals. Anyone can take these items, so check them frequently!

Right-click any NPC to interact.
Some may only respond with the correct item in your inventory.

## Edicts

Every day, two **Society Voices** visit **Sanctuary**:

- First arrives at **09:00**, leaves at **17:00**
- Second arrives at **15:00**, leaves at **22:00**

Each **Society Voice** offer unique **Edicts** that reward **Favor** upon completion.
Earn enough **Favor**, and you will be rewarded with a **Society Reward**.

### Accepting an Edict:

1. Right-click the **Society Voice**
2. Hover over any Edict to view details
3. Left-click to accept

You can only have one active Edict at a time.
Each lasts up to **10 hours**, and there is no penalty for failing **Edict**.

### Renouncing an Edict:

1. Right-click the same **Society Voice**
2. Right-click your active **Edict** (it will shimmer)
3. Left-click “Release Binding” (green button)

There's no penalty for renouncing an Edict.

## The Reliquary

The **Reliquary** is present daily between **09:00 and 23:00**.

His main role is reward you with **Society Rewards** when you have earned enough **Favor**.
**Society Rewards** include useful items and **Emeralds**.

He also hands out a free daily **Alms** (usually food), and will restore a portion of your hunger and health if low.
Be sure to visit him at the start of your day!
