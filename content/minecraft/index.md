# Sweden Mayhem

A unique Minecraft server, split between two worlds: **Sanctuary** and **The Abyss**.

## Sanctuary

Once a perfect world, free from pain, hunger, or need.
But with no limits, its people took everything.

Now, every ore, fish, tree, and blade of grass is gone.
**Sanctuary** stands empty, lifeless, silent.

Its people, now called **Wanderers**, drift through dust and ruin, stripped of meaning.

But something stirs at the heart of **Sanctuary**.
A gate flickers. A path opens.

## The Abyss

A world of eternal darkness, hunger, and chaos.
It punishes the weak and tests the strong.
Its form shifts weekly. Its dangers grow.

Yet it holds the one thing **Sanctuary** lost long ago: *life itself*.

## Your Path

You now stand before the gate, Wanderer.

Enter **The Abyss**. Take back what was lost.
Return. Build. Trade. Discover. Restore.

Fear not, Wanderer, for you are not alone.

Other Wanderers gather. A new purpose awakens.
The heart watches.
