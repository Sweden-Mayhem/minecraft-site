## Sanctuary

Once a perfect world, free from pain, hunger, or need.
But with no limits, its people took everything.
Now, **Sanctuary** lies barren, lifeless, silent, a dead world of dust and ruin.

Its people, now called Wanderers, drift through dust and ruin, stripped of meaning.

But something stirs at the heart of **Sanctuary**.
A gate flickers. A path opens.

## The Abyss

A world of eternal darkness, hunger, and chaos.
It punishes the weak and tests the strong.
Its form shifts weekly. Its dangers grow.

Yet it holds the one thing **Sanctuary** desperately needs: *life*.

## Your Path

You now stand before the gate, Wanderer.

Enter **The Abyss**. Take back what **Sanctuary** lost long ago.
Build. Trade. Discover. Restore. Awaken.

But fear not, for you are not alone.
Other Wanderers gather. A new purpose awakens.
The heart watches...
