# Sweden Mayhem

<center>A unique survival server split between two deeply connected worlds.</center>

## Sanctuary

Once a perfect world — no hunger, no pain, no scarcity. But abundance led to ruin. Its people, now called **Wanderers**, harvested everything until nothing remained.
No trees. No ores. No animals. No life.
Only ruins and mystery.

You are one of these Wanderers.

Now, a strange force stirs at the heart of Sanctuary, a place that connects to other worlds.

## The Abyss

One such world is **The Abyss**.
A brutal, ever-shifting dimension of darkness, starvation, and danger.
It resets weekly. It never forgives. But it holds the one thing Sanctuary lacks: *life*.

## Your Path

Enter The Abyss to gather what Sanctuary has lost.
Return. Build. Trade. Uncover secrets. Restore meaning.

You are not alone. Other Wanderers gather. A new community is forming.
And the heart watches.
